# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- `isShiftCtrlO()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+O (Kitty protocol)
- `isShiftCtrlD()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+D (Kitty protocol)
- `TUI.onDebug` callback for global debug key handling (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- `wrapTextWithAnsi()` utility now exported (wraps text to width, preserving ANSI codes)

### Changed

- README.md completely rewritten with accurate component documentation, theme interfaces, and examples
- `visibleWidth()` reimplemented with grapheme-based width calculation, 10x faster on Bun and ~15% faster on Node ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

### Fixed

- Markdown component now renders HTML tags as plain text instead of silently dropping them ([#359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/359))
- Crash in `visibleWidth()` and grapheme iteration when encountering undefined code points ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- ZWJ emoji sequences (rainbow flag, family, etc.) now render with correct width instead of being split into multiple characters ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input component now accepts Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
